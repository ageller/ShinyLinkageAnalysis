# A fix for installing shinyBS 

There appears to be something wrong with shinyBS when trying to install an R package from GitHub.  See the issue [here](https://github.com/ebailey78/shinyBS/issues/135).  The files in this directory are an attempted workaround, as suggested in that issue.  

These files should only be necessary if installing via remotes.
